Welcome to Gordon
=================

Welcome to Gordon's documentation. I recommend that you get started with :doc:`installation` and then head over to the :doc:`quickstart`.
Besides the Quickstart, there are also several tutorials for some of the different available event sources.

If you are the kind of person who wants to learn by example, there are lot's in our `Examples <https://github.com/jorgebastida/gordon/tree/master/examples>`_ directory in github.
